# Eviction Notice Flow - Questions and Answers

## Question 1
**User:** I just got an eviction notice. What do I do?

**Answer:** I'm really glad you reached out. Getting an eviction notice can feel scary, but you don't have to go through it alone. First, try to stay calm and read the notice carefully—look for the reason listed and any deadlines. In the City of San Diego, there are local tenant protections that may apply to you, depending on the reason your landlord is trying to end your tenancy.

The San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC) worked with the City to provide a Tenant Protection Guide that explains the City's Residential Tenant Protections Ordinance and gives educational information about tenants' rights and resources. This guide is for general information only.

I'm not a lawyer, but I can point you toward information and local resources that may help you understand your options, starting with SDHC's Tenant Protections information page.

## Question 2
**User:** Is my landlord allowed to evict me for this?

**Answer:** Whether your landlord is allowed to evict you depends on the reason listed in the notice and the laws that apply where you live. In many cases, landlords must have a legally valid reason—such as nonpayment of rent, certain serious lease violations, or a qualifying no-fault reason like the owner moving into the unit.

The City of San Diego has a Residential Tenant Protections Ordinance, in addition to state law. The City's Tenant Protection Guide, which SDHC was required to prepare, explains when 'just cause' is required, what notices must include, and what protections may apply if you receive a termination notice. It is meant to be educational, not legal advice.

It's important to check the reason stated on your notice, note any dates and deadlines, and keep copies of everything you receive. For legal advice about whether your landlord is allowed to evict you in your situation, it's best to talk with a local legal aid or tenant rights organization.

## Question 3
**User:** What if I'm behind on rent?

**Answer:** If you're behind on rent, that's one of the most common reasons landlords start the eviction process. It can feel overwhelming, but there may still be options.

• Talk to your landlord early if you haven't already. Sometimes you can discuss a payment plan or short-term arrangement.
• Look into rental assistance programs that may help with back rent if you qualify.
• Get information about your rights as a tenant before you agree to anything in writing.

The San Diego Housing Commission administers federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance in the City of San Diego, and its 'Help With Your Rent' page provides information about rental assistance and how to apply when wait lists are open.

## Question 4
**User:** How much time do I have before I have to move out?

**Answer:** The amount of time you have usually depends on the type of notice you received and the laws that apply. Some notices give you a certain number of days to pay what you owe or fix a problem. Others tell you to move out by a specific date. Court documents have their own deadlines and requirements.

It's important to look closely at the dates on your notice, keep track of any deadlines, and avoid ignoring anything you receive from a court—there are often strict timelines to respond.

The City of San Diego's Tenant Protection Guide, prepared by SDHC, describes different types of termination notices and provides general information about protections for residential tenants. For exact timelines and legal options in your situation, a local legal aid or tenant rights organization is the best place to get personalized advice.

## Question 5
**User:** Can SDHC stop my eviction?

**Answer:** SDHC cannot step into your specific court case or directly stop an eviction for you, and it does not act as your attorney. However, SDHC shares information about tenant protections, rental assistance programs, and homelessness solutions that may be helpful as you explore your options.

If you're facing an eviction, it can be very important to:

• Talk with a legal aid or tenant rights organization as soon as possible.
• Ask about any emergency rental assistance or mediation programs that may be available.
• Collect and organize all of your paperwork so you can clearly explain your situation.

SDHC's website can help you learn more about local programs and services that might be relevant.

## Question 6
**User:** What if I have nowhere to go?

**Answer:** I'm really sorry you're going through this. Worrying about where you'll go is incredibly stressful. If you think you may have nowhere to stay, it's important to reach out for help as early as you can.

The San Diego Housing Commission is a key partner in addressing homelessness in the City of San Diego and works to increase housing opportunities that serve people who are at risk of or already experiencing homelessness. SDHC's Homelessness Solutions pages describe programs and initiatives, including HOUSING FIRST – SAN DIEGO, that focus on connecting individuals and families to housing with supportive services.

These programs can't promise a specific outcome, but they may help connect you with available resources, depending on eligibility and availability.

## Question 7
**User:** Who can I talk to for legal help?

**Answer:** For legal advice about an eviction notice, the best option is usually a local legal aid or tenant rights organization. They can help you understand whether the notice you received follows local and state law, what your options may be if you want to challenge the eviction, and what deadlines you need to meet if you receive court documents.

The City of San Diego's Tenant Protection Guide, prepared by SDHC, is meant to provide educational information about tenant protections and point to resources, but it is not legal advice. SDHC shares information about tenant protections and community resources, but it does not provide legal representation.

Reaching out to a legal aid organization as early as possible can make a big difference.

## Question 8
**User:** How do I contact SDHC about this?

**Answer:** You can contact the San Diego Housing Commission using the information on its Contact Us page. SDHC serves customers by phone, email, mail, virtually, and in person. The page includes a general phone number and links to department contact information.

When you reach out, it can help to have your paperwork ready—like your eviction notice and any letters you've received—so you can quickly share the basics of your situation.
